### Get started

Apexo (as an application, technically speaking) is just a static HTML, CSS & JS. It communicates with the database directly, without an API layer. Files gets served directly from your dropbox (in case of the community version) using an access token you provide.

So all what is offered is a static HTML, CSS & JS, the rest is up to you to install and setup.

This document will provide you with the simple steps that you need to make to get started. The process is composed of 3 essential steps and one optional one:

1. Setting up the front
2. Setting up the server
3. Setting up DropBox
4. Translating to your own language (optional)
